# A-B-N_testing_best_charging_algorithm
This repository contains code and documentation for evaluating battery charging algorithms through statistical analysis. We developed a framework for comparing multiple charging algorithms against the traditional Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CCCV) method using A/B/N testing and post-hoc analysis.
